## Possible errors in data

If you spot an error in the data, please let me know. Since I collected data from several outside sources and pdfs, some minor errors may occur.

## A note on data mining

Current data collection is far from a severe collection/dataset for performing data mining since this is only a personal collection of past race results. However, if you find it interesting to mine this data, please let me know. I am keen to see any new insight from these data :)
